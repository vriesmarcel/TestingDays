# Session abstract:
Do you find it hard to create and maintain automated tests for your applications? Have you created automated tests but find them hard to maintain? Are you looking for ways to speed up and scale your test runs so you have faster results? This session will teach you how to build maintainable automated test suites using Microsoft Playwright services on Azure integrated into your CI/CD workflows on Azure DevOps or GitHub. In this session, you'll learn to build maintainable test suites by default. It will introduce concepts like Page Objects, DRY, and DAMP tests. You will also learn how to apply these patterns to Playwright and use cloud services to scale up and speed up your tests.
